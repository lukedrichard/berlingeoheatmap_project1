Analysis of Geovisualizations: Demand for Additional Electric Charging Stations

Based on the heatmap visualization:

- High Demand Areas: These are areas with:
->  High population density.
->  A noticeably low number of charging stations.
->  These areas likely include city centers or residential neighborhoods with multi-family homes, where residents cannot install private chargers.

- Low Demand Areas: These are areas with:
->  Low population density and a moderate to sufficient number of charging stations.
->  Suburban or rural regions with a high proportion of one-family houses, where residents can install private chargers.

Key Observations:
- Inner-city Districts: Likely to have a high demand for charging stations due to high population density and a lack of private parking spaces.

- Peripheral Areas: Generally have lower demand, but clusters with significant population density and insufficient charging infrastructure might still exhibit demand.

- Commercial Zones: Areas with a high concentration of offices or businesses might also have elevated demand, especially during work hours.
